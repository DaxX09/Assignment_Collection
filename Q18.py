"""
What are negative indexes and why are they used?
=> Negative index is used in python to begin sclicing from the end of the string.
i.e start:stop:step
For eg. name="Python"
here,
 P    Y    T    H   O    N 
-6   -5   -4   -3  -2   -1
the above represents negative index.
print(name[-1])
